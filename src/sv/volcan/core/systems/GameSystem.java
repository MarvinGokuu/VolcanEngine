     * 3. Returns in deterministic time (< 1ms typically)

     * MODEL: Single-threaded per system
     * - The Kernel can execute DIFFERENT systems in parallel
     * - The Kernel NEVER executes the SAME system concurrently
     * - No locks required inside the system
     * 
     * PARALLEL EXECUTION EXAMPLE:
     * Thread 1: MovementSystem.update(frame, dt)
     * Thread 2: SpriteSystem.update(frame, dt) // OK: different systems
     * 
     * FORBIDDEN EXAMPLE:
     * Thread 1: MovementSystem.update(frame1, dt)
     * Thread 2: MovementSystem.update(frame2, dt) // NEVER: same system

     * 
     * DEFINITION: For the same input state and deltaTime, the system
     * must produce exactly the same output state.
     * 
     * MATHEMATICALLY:
     * update(state, dt) = result
     * update(state, dt) = result // Always the same result
     * 
     * APPLICATIONS:
     * - REPLAY: Record inputs and reproduce exact game
     * - NETCODE: Synchronize clients with only inputs (no full state)
     * - DEBUGGING: Reproduce bugs consistently
     * - TESTING: Deterministic and reproducible tests
     * 
     * HOW TO GUARANTEE IT:
     * [OK] Use only data from WorldStateFrame
     * [OK] Use provided deltaTime (not System.currentTimeMillis())
     * [OK] Use frame seeds for random (not Math.random())
     * [OK] Avoid non-deterministic floating-point (use double, not float)

     * 
     * TARGET: < 1ms per system for 60 FPS
     * 
     * TIME BUDGET (60 FPS = 16.6ms per frame):
     * - Input Processing: 1ms
     * - Bus Processing: 0.5ms
     * - Systems Execution: 10ms (distributed among N systems)
     * - State Hashing: 0.5ms
     * - Rendering: 4ms
     * - Buffer: 0.6ms
     * 
     * OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
     * 1. Cache Locality: Sequential memory access
     * 2. SIMD: Vectorized operations when possible
     * 3. Branch Prediction: Minimize if/else in loops
     * 4. Prefetching: CPU can predict accesses

     * @param state     Immutable snapshot of the world state (Single Source of
     *                  Truth).
     *                  This frame contains ALL game data in Off-Heap memory.
     * 
     *                  ACCESS:
     *                  - Read: state.readDouble(offset), state.readInt(offset)
     *                  - Write: state.writeDouble(offset, value)
     * 
     *                  IMMUTABILITY:
     *                  - The frame does NOT change during update()
     *                  - Writes go to a buffer that is committed later
     *                  - This guarantees all systems see the same state
     * 
     * @param deltaTime Time elapsed since the last tick in seconds.
     * 
     *                  TYPICAL RANGE: 0.016 seconds (60 FPS) to 0.033 seconds (30
     *                  FPS)
     * 
     *                  USAGE:
     *                  - Physics: position += velocity * deltaTime
     *                  - Animation: frame += frameRate * deltaTime
     *                  - Timers: timer -= deltaTime
     * 
     *                  DETERMINISM:
     *                  - The Kernel guarantees deltaTime is consistent
     *                  - For the same tick, all systems see the same
     *                  deltaTime
     *                  - Do not use System.nanoTime() or similar
     * 
     * @throws RuntimeException Only in cases of unrecoverable errors
     *                          (memory corruption, contract violation)
