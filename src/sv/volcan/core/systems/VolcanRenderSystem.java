     * PRECONDITIONS (what the Kernel guarantees):
     * 1. state != null and is consistent (does not change during render)
     * 3. Called from the AWT/Swing thread
     * 4. State was already updated by all GameSystems
     * 
     * POSTCONDITIONS (what the system must guarantee):
     * 1. Only READS data from the state (does not modify)
     * 2. Does not create unnecessary objects (minimize GC)

     * TIME BUDGET (60 FPS = 16.6ms per frame):
     * - Game Logic: 10ms
     * - Rendering: 4-5ms (THIS METHOD)
     * - Buffer swap: 1-2ms
     * 
     * OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
     * 1. Batching: Group similar draw calls
     * 2. Culling: Do not draw what is outside the screen
     * 3. Sprite Atlas: A single texture for multiple sprites
     * 4. Object Pooling: Reuse drawing objects
