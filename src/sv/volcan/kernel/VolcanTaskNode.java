/**
 * RESPONSIBILITY: Atomic node in the Directed Acyclic Task Graph (DAG).
 *
 * WHY NODES INSTEAD OF LAYERS:
 * The legacy layer-based executor forces a global barrier after each layer, even if
 * only 1 system in the layer is the bottleneck. For example: if Layer 2 has 5 systems
 * and 4 finish in 0.1ms while 1 takes 2ms, all 4 idle threads wait 1.9ms doing nothing.
 * With DAG nodes, each system independently decrements its dependents' counters the instant
 * it finishes — no global barrier, 100% core utilization.
 *
 * TECHNIQUE: Fine-Grained Dependency Tracking via AtomicInteger countdown.
 *   - pendingDeps: starts at N (number of unfinished predecessors), decrements to 0.
 *   - When pendingDeps reaches 0, this node is ready to execute.
 *   - After execution, decrements successors' pendingDeps atomically.
 *
 * MEMORY LAYOUT: Intentionally flat arrays (no linked lists) to avoid pointer-chasing
 * and to keep hot data within L1/L2 cache lines.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * - pendingDeps: AtomicInteger — lock-free decrements from multiple threads.
 * - All other fields are written ONCE during graph compilation (init), read-only at runtime.
 * - state/deltaTime written by dispatcher BEFORE node is published as ready.
