                    VOLCAN ENGINE - BUILD PROTOCOL v4.3
================================================================================

High-performance rendering infrastructure and temporal control system for
mission-critical applications.

1. ARCHITECTURE
---------------
Memory model: Off-heap state management with atomic event dispatch.
- State: WorldStateFrame (native memory)
- Events: 64-bit signals via VolcanAtomicBus
- Logic: Pure systems operating on native memory (SovereignSystem)

2. CORE COMPONENTS
------------------
- SovereignKernel: 4-phase loop orchestrator (60 FPS)
- VolcanAtomicBus: Lock-free ring buffer for event transport
- VolcanSectorManager: Spatial management with bit-packing
- VolcanEventDispatcher: Multi-lane event distribution

3. OPTIMIZATION RULES
---------------------
1. Zero-allocation: No object creation in hot paths
2. Data locality: Sequential memory access (EntityLayout with stride)
3. Atomic signals: No strings for internal events
4. Determinism: Same seed + input = bit-perfect results

4. DATA TYPES
-------------
- Primitives (long/int): High-performance math (sectors, hashing)
- Objects: Initialization and tooling only (cold paths)
- SovereignSpaceMath: (Planned) 3D grid calculations

5. BUILD PROCESS
----------------
Use build.bat for compilation.
- Zero compiler warnings required
- All noise components must be neutralized before startup
